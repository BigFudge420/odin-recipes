# odin-recipes

Made this cus I had to. It was a project that I had to make in The Odin Project, It's site where you can learn web dev for free (It's actually great). You can check it out here: https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard.

So yea a very basic site with a few recipes. It doesn't work on Mobile or Tablets for now, made only for browsers working on Laptops and PCs
